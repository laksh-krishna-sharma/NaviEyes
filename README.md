# NaviEyes – A Real-Time Accessibility Companion for the Visually Impaired

In a world where visual impairment can limit everyday experiences, **NaviEyes** aims to change the narrative by offering a real-time, immersive, and intuitive solution. Powered by **Groq's ultra-fast inference capabilities**, NaviEyes leverages cutting-edge technology to bridge the gap between what the visually impaired can’t see and the world they deserve to experience.

### How NaviEyes Fits into the Groq Track

Groq’s **high-performance AI** enables us to process live camera feeds, extract meaningful context, and provide **instantaneous scene descriptions** and **text-to-speech (TTS)** feedback, all in **real-time**. This app seamlessly combines **computer vision**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **speech synthesis** into a powerful tool that helps users navigate the world around them. 

By using Groq’s **image captioning** and **OCR (optical character recognition)**, we allow users to hear descriptions of their surroundings, identify text on documents, signs, or labels, and ask context-aware questions to understand more about their environment. Additionally, NaviEyes incorporates **location access** to find nearby places, such as cafes, hospitals, or schools, based on user queries.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time scene descriptions** using Groq’s image captioning.
- **Text-to-speech (TTS)** for OCR functionality—reading signs, documents, and labels aloud.
- **Natural language processing (NLP)** to answer user questions with context-aware responses.
  
### Why NaviEyes and Groq?
